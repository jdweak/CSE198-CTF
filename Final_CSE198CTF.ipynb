However, in the real world simple dictionary attacks can still be a bit slow. Hashing every password in the dictionary can actually take quite a while. Many encryption algorithms specifically designed for password hashing like Bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt are designed to be much slower to improve resistance against password cracking. Additionally, when our dictionary grows from 950 passwords to millions, you can see how dictionary attacks can become quite slow.\n",

In this excersise, use the rainbow_table.csv file to quickly find the password associated with the hash\n",
