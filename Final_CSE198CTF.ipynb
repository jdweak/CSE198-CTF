Many encryption algorithms specifically designed for password hashing like Bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt are designed to be much slower to improve resistance against password cracking. Additionally, when our dictionary grows from a few hundred passwords to millions, you can see how dictionary attacks can become quite slow.\n",
